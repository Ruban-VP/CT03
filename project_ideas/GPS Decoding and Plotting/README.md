# GPS Decoding and Plotting
## Problem Statement
Receive and decode GPS signals and get a coordinate on a map of your location, using only an RTL-SDR dongle (with bias tee) and GPS antenna.
## Description
The RTL-SDR can be used to receive, decode and plot Global Positioning System (GPS) data in real time. To do this the RTL-SDR must be connected to a GPS antenna. You can get the GPS strength of different satellites and plot your current coordinates.
