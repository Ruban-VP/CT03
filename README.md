The following are the resources used to explore Communication Systems:
## DSP Course
* [DSP Specialization by EPFL](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dsp1)
* For more detailed explanations of specific topics in the above course, you can also refer to [DSP by MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-6-008-digital-signal-processing-spring-2011/video-lectures/)
## About Software Defined Radios
* You can watch the lectures/demostrations on introduction to SDRs on [Software Defined Radio with HackRF](https://greatscottgadgets.com/sdr/).
* Follow the above leecture series by installing GNURadio by doing the tasks. Most tasks do not need an SDR and it helps get familiar with GNURadio.
* Implement an FM Receiver on GNURadio.
## About Wireless Communications
* Go through and understand the topics on [Wireless Lab IITM](https://varun19299.github.io/wireless-lab-iitm/)
## Extra Stuff
* [Web SDR](http://websdr.org/)
* [RTL SDR](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/) - For ideas on SDR projects
## Note
As I was already familiar with continuous time signals, it was easy to understand the DSP course by relating it to the continuous time case. I started with the DSP specialization on Coursera which was really interesting because of the real world examples. Many of the concepts weren't immediately clear so I also had to refer to the DSP course on MITOCW. After this, I started with the video series on Software Defined Radios on Great Scott Gadgets. While doing this course, try relating it to the concepts learnt in the DSP Course. Also try implementing everything on your own in GNURadio. Then I went through the Wireless concepts on the Wireless Lab IITM website and I also tried understanding the code. This required many google searches and backgroud reading as a lot of the concepts were new. After this, I moved onto a few handson projects with SDRs. It was really interesting to see everything I learnt in theory work in real life. Many interesting projects can be found on the official RTL-SDR website.
