# Receiving Weather Balloon Data
## Problem Statement
Tracking and receiving Weather Balloon Data with an SDR, appropriate antenna and required software.
## Description
Around the world meteorological weather balloons are launched twice daily, and continuously transit weather telemetry to a ground station using something called a radiosonde. The RTL-SDR software defined radio combined with a decoding program can be used to intercept this telemetry, and display it on your own computer. You will be able to see real time graphs and data of air temperature, humidity, pressure as well as the location and height of the balloon as it makes it's ascent.
