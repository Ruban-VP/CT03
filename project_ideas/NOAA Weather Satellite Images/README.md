# NOAA Weather Satellite Images
## Problem Statement
Set up a NOAA weather satellite receiving station, which will allow you to gather several live weather satellite images each day.
## Description
Everyday multiple NOAA weather satellites pass above you. Each NOAA weather satellite broadcasts an Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) signal, which contains a live weather image of your area. The RTL-SDR dongle combined with a good antenna, SDRSharp and a decoding program can be used to download and display these live images several times a day.
